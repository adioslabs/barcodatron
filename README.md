BARCODATRON

Run a local web server which accepts small batch barcodes 
Mostly passes request up to the real server to get data
It will also intercept certain commands in order to print labels 
on special label printers 'n such.


Runs on the python-based Flask web microframework 

http://flask.pocoo.org/

In addition it requires Twitter Boostrap 3

http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/

Just overlay this on top of your flask directory structure and you should be good to go
